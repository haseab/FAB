To Do List to Optimize this code:
- Add bm_strategy to test code
- Add exchange API access to an example exchange (Most probably a crypto exchange because of the simplicity)
- Find more efficient way to do trade_statistic calculation (in backtest.py)


Ideas
- Risk zones
- Filtering daterange based on a common price movement
- Voting system on timeframes
- Dependent prices?
- Sensitivity to seasonal or monthly or yearly changes?
- incorporating unsupervised algorithm to gather patterns in price
