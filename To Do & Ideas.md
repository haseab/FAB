### To Do List to Optimize this code:
1. [ ] Add exchange API access to an example exchange (Most probably a crypto exchange because of the simplicity)
2. [ ] Find more efficient way to do trade_statistic calculation (in backtest.py)



### Ideas
1. [ ] Risk zones
2. [ ] Filtering daterange based on a common price movement
3. [ ] Voting system on timeframes
4. [ ] Dependent asset prices?
5. [ ] Sensitivity to seasonal or monthly or yearly changes?
6. [ ] incorporating unsupervised algorithm to gather patterns in price
